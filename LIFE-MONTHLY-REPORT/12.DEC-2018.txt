Paku got minor slip disc. Did MRI for Rs 8,500 and Physio for Rs 5000 from the Columbia Asia hospital. She is feeling better in one week. She was in immense pain. I could see the importance of daily workout in her pain. Our human body is so sensitive.
3. Health - My weight has increased to 80Kg. This is because of my overeating. I have started overeating and snacking this month. I was slack this month. But then, I will be reverting to my regime of less food from now onwards. Also I will have to be regular with my workout. The weight has to be reduced to 77 atleast!
