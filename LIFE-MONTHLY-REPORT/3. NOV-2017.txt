NOTE WEEKLY ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
NOTE : [11/05]
[11/01] - Today The day went pretty happening. I am grateful to God for this. I woke up late at around 7:30am, and then had paratha and sabji. I worked on my jrnl from morning, and then did also meditation. I brought out a red small book as my daily diary to write, and I have decided to have it with me always, as my daily scratchpad. I am discontinuing to carry that big iimb notebook for my offic and all LSWs attached to it. Instead I have decided to carry this small notebook, and have only my current month's LSW with it. I will keep my old LSWs in my shelf at office. This will make my bag leaner and my daily scratchpad more accessible.
I went to get Arshia from her friend's home. And then after coming home slept after lunch. Today the refrigerator was delivered. I did not do my yoga. But did my 30 mins meditation. That is OK.
I also updated my yrly highlights in my IDP. That was great. Also completed week 1 of the cource 3 in positive psychology.
Today I decided to do away with machine learning all together, and not waste my energy and time into it. I will be instead focusing on psychology.
Also I masturbated late tonight thrice, after couple of days. After the third masturbation in row, following is what is in my mind -
Sex with human is a wasted time, effort and energy. It leads to other complications. The best, fastest and most optimum experiential sex experience is masturbating watching porn. It takes max 10 mins including washing and cleaning. And it leads to so much peace. Also I have observed the importance of daily masturbation. A 5 minutes of masturbation saves hours of waste time and energy not only in waking hours but also screws up your sleep as you get non sense dreams.
SEX is NONSENSE. NEVER WASTE MORE THAN 10 MINS IN IT. IT is a necessary evil. Good that self-sex is so easy, free and comfortable and equally enjoyable.


NOTE : [11/12]
This week went busy in work. But then I am continuing with my focus on social psychology. I am going deep into the definition of the social psychology as a stream. I am loving the domain, and I will give my full loyalty and 100% focus into it.



NOTE : [11/19]
This week is the turning point in my life, where I am getting back to my old self, with clean shaved person, and giving proper attention to my grooming. I understand the presentability is important. And myself being a psychologist, it is even more important to me to be presentable. I had a hair cut, and shaved and applied after shave. I also combed after several years. I am grateful to you God for giving me this novelty, and creativity in my life.

I did not do daily walking and yoga and meditation a single day this week. I instead, utilized the time in reading and learning.



NOTE : [1 NOV 2017]
I was able to convince Paku to prepare for PhD in Org Behavior. This will help me to work with her in the same field. Now, I am developing a world in long term that will aid in creating a positive difference in the world based on our family temperament. I am grateful to God that Paku shares the same temperament as I.
I started with 3rd course in positive psychology and have started to go deep dive into the Grit paper on predicting effectiveness and retention of novice teachers based on Grit.
