#Assignment 1 - Introduction to Machine Learning
#For this assignment, you will be using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database to create a classifier that can help diagnose patients. First, read through the description of the dataset (below).

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
#The object returned by load_breast_cancer() is a scikit-learn Bunch object, which is similar to a dictionary.â€‹
cancer = load_breast_cancer()
#print(cancer.DESCR) # Print the data set description
cancer.keys()
cancer['feature_names']

'''
Question 0 (Example)
#How many features does the breast cancer dataset have?
#This function should return an integer.
# You should write your whole answer within the function provided. The autograder will call
# this function and compare the return value against the correct solution value
'''
def answer_zero():
    # This function returns the number of features of the breast cancer dataset, which is an integer.
    # The assignment question description will tell you the general format the autograder is expecting
    return len(cancer['feature_names'])

# You can examine what your function returns by calling it in the cell. If you have questions
# about the assignment formats, check out the discussion forums for any FAQs

Question 1
Scikit-learn works with lists, numpy arrays, scipy-sparse matrices, and pandas DataFrames, so converting the dataset to a DataFrame is not necessary for training this model. Using a DataFrame does however help make many things easier such as munging data, so let's practice creating a classifier with a pandas DataFrame.

Convert the sklearn.dataset cancer to a DataFrame.
This function should return a (569, 31) DataFrame with

columns =

['mean radius', 'mean texture', 'mean perimeter', 'mean area',
'mean smoothness', 'mean compactness', 'mean concavity',
'mean concave points', 'mean symmetry', 'mean fractal dimension',
'radius error', 'texture error', 'perimeter error', 'area error',
'smoothness error', 'compactness error', 'concavity error',
'concave points error', 'symmetry error', 'fractal dimension error',
'worst radius', 'worst texture', 'worst perimeter', 'worst area',
'worst smoothness', 'worst compactness', 'worst concavity',
'worst concave points', 'worst symmetry', 'worst fractal dimension',
'target']
and index =

RangeIndex(start=0, stop=569, step=1)
'''
df = pd.DataFrame(cancer['data'], columns = cancer['feature_names'])
df['target'] = cancer['target']
df.head()
'''
Question 2
What is the class distribution? (i.e. how many instances of malignant (encoded 0) and how many benign (encoded 1)?)

This function should return a Series named target of length 2 with integer values and index = ['malignant', 'benign']
'''
freq_dist = df['target'].value_counts()
#print (freq_dist)
#print(freq_dist.values)
#target = pd.Series([freq_dist[0],freq_dist[1]], index = ['malignant', 'benign'])
target = pd.Series(freq_dist.values, index = ['malignant', 'benign'])
print (target)
#target = pd.Series (freq_dist, index = ['malignant', 'benign'])
#print (target)


'''
Question 3
Split the DataFrame into X (the data) and y (the labels).

This function should return a tuple of length 2: (X, y), where

X, a pandas DataFrame, has shape (569, 30)
y, a pandas Series, has shape (569,).
