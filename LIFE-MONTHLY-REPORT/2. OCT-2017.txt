NOTE WEEKLY ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
NOTE : [15 OCT 2017]
# I became clear in one thing as I was doing my course on positive psychology, is that I will be a computer scientist turned psychologist. I will delve deeper into the area of positive psychology and utilize my experiences in AI to do something novel in that area. So, for me PhD in positive psychology is a worthwhile goal.


NOTE : [22 OCT 2017]
I continued to drive this week with the clarity on psychology and organization behavior. That added focus helped me to complete the 2nd course on positive psychology, and start with full focus the 3rd course on positive pscyhology.
Listening to the professor's lecture I got the language for my pursuit, and updated the same in the Overview&Reflection sheet of LIFE-OF-SERVICE. This setup centers me totally into the path of Seva as taught by Guru Gobind Singh ji and Guruji. Today I completed the 1st course of deeplearning and also the 2nd course from positive pscyhology specialization.

I was earlier thinking of the traditional way of PhD etc. But then, today after thinking a lot understood that the MS/PhD is not gonna happen as HTS does not have seats reserved for sponsored candidates. And it is not worth to leave the job and pursue these courses full time. I know I want to do them. But then the essence is a direction and learning, and ofcourse the main cause is SEVA. For that I need not to do the PhD or any other traditional degree right away. This is because for me, right now the highest priority is the studies of Geema, and enabling her life. I can always do all these things once Geema is independent. Something like what Subramaniam Swamy or Rajeev Malhotra is doing today. So, no need to be disheartened or lose any hope. I am grooved into doing something very important - shaping the life of a human being - my daughter. This is the biggest SEVA.
Being a follower of Nanak Baba, I should always be centered on to seva.

I became present to the fact that I will have to simplify and reduce the todos of my life, based on the priorities. At this point of time in my life Studies and attending to Arshia is more important. So, I decided to do away with the Sudarshan Kriya and Padmasadhana. I am trying to replace them with daily walking. This is with the aim to utilize that time of sudarshan kriya to studies. So, I am updating my service to self stream to remove the things that i am reducing to simplify my life.

As always happens to me, more I delve deeper into positive psychology, more I feel that this is the subject for me. My bad experiences with Ramya Ranganathan was because I was stuck with the Vedas, which was a foolish thing to do. Positive psychology perhaps is not about just religion. It is more about science and philosophy - this probably bridges my training and my passion. I should perhaps following positive psychology as my long term career. My love for computers and maths might help me to do scientific research in this area.

# Oct 15th, 2017
Today I saw that it is possible to do the PHD in Psychology from IGNOU too. I will work on that. This is the default case. And then having done PHD from IGNOU I can always do my teaching work. I can apply to places for a job on teaching. This will set the stage set. In the process, I will continue doing my machine learning that will maintain my touch with programing and the world of computers. This will enable me to do something novel during my PHD and post doctoral fellowship in org behavior. I can always do the same from USA.
