#EPOCH 3 - SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY 
---------------------------------------------

I spent the whole 4 months, delving deep into my MA Psychology studies. I was deeply moved by the Social Psychology domain. And did quite a good deep dive into the books and the IGNOU notes. I was also regularly doing my positive pscyhology course at the Coursera. 

It was during this time when Geema also got call for the Katha workshop to Delhi. I went there and was also seeing the sessions from the JNU professors with the model of Social Pyschology. 

It is during this time, I started a new project to create a curriculum for teaching social psychology to the students in high school. I wrote to GEAR too. Also I started deeply contemplating designing this course material. I had left Deep Learning and Mathematics, and went deep only to social pscyhology. I had already enrolled to MA Psychology from IGNOU.
